                <p>
                    If Live Life Protected does not enforce any provision of this agreement such will not be considered a waiver of any provision or right.

                <p>
                    In the event that any part of these terms and conditions is held to be unenforceable, such part will at Live Life Protected's option be construed as far as possible to reflect the parties' intentions and the remainder of the provisions will remain in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and Live Life Protected and shall apply to the exclusion of all other terms or conditions of contract which you may purport to propose.
